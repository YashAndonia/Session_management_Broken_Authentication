# Session_management_Broken_Authentication
A project to display how a website can be attacked through session mismanagement on php. There are 2 website samples here- website 1(DO) and website 2(Blank_Page)
Start off by going to Do)issue. Start at Do_161493.html and progress through the website by clicking on register
Then go to Cricket tournament, after filling the login page and filling the details.
If you copy paste the url you will be able to recreate the session again, which is a type of broken authentication, due to lack of session management.
The solution to this is by using Session variables and creating a logout function.
All of these are implemented in the Solution part.

Note:Install Xampp or Apache or something similar to make the php files work!
